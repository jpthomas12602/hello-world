# hello-world
Just my first Repository.  
Hello, I am a 40 something year old stay at home dad to a 4 year old boy and 2 year old girl. I completed my associates for Network Security in 2011 but was unable to find work in the field. I started going back to school around 2014 to get a 4yr degree. I was on a fast track to complete since my wife suggested I quit my current job and go to school as much as I could handle. Then my boy arrived in 2016 and I had to hit the brakes. Since then various life events have slowed my pace to that of a leisurely stroll. My wife is an engineer who manages other engineers at the Toyota plant and her work definitley makes it hard to find time for school work but so far we have made it work. When I am not cleaning, cooking, making sure the boy and girl dont break anything I day dream about sleeping and woodworking and having the time to do both.
